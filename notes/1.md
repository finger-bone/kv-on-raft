# Introduction to the Raft Algorithm

Raft is a **consensus algorithm** that is widely used in distributed systems. It is designed to be **fault-tolerant** and **robust**.

Raft is now used in many popular distributed systems, such as: Zookeeper, etcd, and Kubernetes. It is the only algorithm that is guaranteed to yield a **strong consistency** result for now.

Raft is a **consensus algorithm**. This means that it doesn't guarantee **consistency**. Consistency is a property meaning that, the whole distributed system, as a whole, behaves as if a single thread single machine. Whereas Raft doesn't guarantee consistency, it guarantees **consensus**, that every node in the distributed system agrees on the same thing, such as a certain value.
